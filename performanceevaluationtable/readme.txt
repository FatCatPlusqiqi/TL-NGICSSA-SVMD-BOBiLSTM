=====Performance Evaluation Table for Optimization Algorithms=====
File Description
This table presents the performance of various optimization algorithms on different test functions (cec2005: f1-f23). 
The results include the best-obtained value, stability, average performance, and the worst-case outcomes for each algorithm.

Column Descriptions
Function: The target function being optimized (the optimization problem).
f1-f23: Names of the specific test functions.
Real min: The theoretical global minimum value of the target function, used as a reference.
Algorithm: The names of the optimization algorithms being evaluated, such as:
NGICSSA: Enhanced Sparrow Search Algorithm
DBO: Dragonfly Optimization Algorithm
SSA: Sparrow Search Algorithm
OMA: Euclidean Optimization Algorithm
COA: Chaos Optimization Algorithm
Other algorithms are also listed.
Min: The smallest value found by the algorithm during multiple experiments. A value closer to the theoretical minimum (Real min) indicates better performance.
Standard Deviation: The standard deviation of results across multiple experiments, reflecting the variability in performance. A smaller value indicates higher stability.
Average: The average value of results across multiple experiments, representing the overall performance of the algorithm.
Mean: The median value of results, providing another measure of central tendency.
Worse: The worst result obtained during the experiments, used to evaluate the algorithm's performance in the least favorable conditions.

Interpretation of the Table
1. Test Function f1
Theoretical Minimum (Real min): 0.
Algorithm Performance:
NGICSSA: The theoretical minimum (Min = 0) is achieved, with all results being consistent (Standard Deviation = 0). It is considered to have performed perfectly on f1.
SSA: The theoretical minimum is also achieved, but the variability is slightly higher (Standard Deviation = 8.85208E-75).
OMA: Poor performance is observed, with a minimum value of 69.45488524 and significant variability (Standard Deviation = 317.1551572).
Other Algorithms: Algorithms such as COA and WOA achieved values close to the theoretical minimum but showed less stability.

Purpose
